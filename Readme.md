This Repository Contains the Source Code for all aspects of a small game I used to play.

This game was a subgame / Minigame inside a popular MOBA called DoTA 2. Now, it was removed after a complete revamp of it's UI and Engine.

This game can be found at http://www.dota2.com/quiz

I am trying to replicate that game as well as add some extra features in the nearby future.


Edit:
I am currently scraping this code from my machines. It resides only on this repo. I am going ahead with a new UI and much more streamlined version than this. This code is still be available here just in case.
